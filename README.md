# Performant Job Shop Scheduling (PER-JSP)

A high-performance Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) solver with C++ core and Python bindings. The project provides both a fast C++ library and intuitive Python interface for solving JSSP using various algorithms including Q-Learning and Actor-Critic methods.

## Features

- üöÄ High-performance C++ core with Python bindings
- üêç Pure Python fallback implementation
- üîß Flexible environment configuration
- üìä Built-in visualization
- üìà Support for standard benchmark problems (Taillard)
- üßÆ Multiple solver algorithms

## Installation

There are two ways to install PER-JSP:

### 1. Python-Only Installation (Fast Install)
For users who only need the Python implementation without C++ optimizations:

```bash
PYTHON_ONLY=1 pip install .
```

This installation:
- ‚úÖ No C++ compiler needed
- ‚úÖ No system dependencies required
- ‚úÖ Quick installation
- ‚ùå Lower performance compared to C++ version

### 2. Full Installation (With C++ Extensions)
For users who want maximum performance:

First, install system dependencies:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    cmake \
    ninja-build \
    git \
    pkg-config \
    libgl-dev \
    libglu1-mesa-dev \
    libxrandr-dev \
    libxinerama-dev \
    libxcursor-dev \
    libxi-dev \
    python3-dev

# macOS
brew install cmake ninja pkg-config

# Windows (with Visual Studio installed)
# No additional dependencies needed
```

Then install the package:
```bash
pip install .
```

This installation:
- ‚úÖ Maximum performance
- ‚úÖ All features available
- ‚ùì Requires system dependencies
- ‚ùì Longer installation time

## Quick Start

```python
from per_jsp import Environment, QLearning

# Create environment
env = Environment.from_taillard(1)  # Load Taillard instance 1

# Create solver
solver = QLearning(
    env,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    discount_factor=0.9,
    exploration_rate=0.1
)

# Train
solver.train(episodes=1000)

# Get solution
schedule = solver.get_best_schedule()
schedule.visualize()
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Problem Instance

```python
from per_jsp import Environment

# Define your problem
problem = {
    "jobs": [
        {"operations": [
            {"machine": 0, "processing_time": 10},
            {"machine": 1, "processing_time": 20}
        ]},
        {"operations": [
            {"machine": 1, "processing_time": 15},
            {"machine": 0, "processing_time": 25}
        ]}
    ]
}

# Create environment
env = Environment.from_dict(problem)
```

### Using Different Solvers

```python
from per_jsp import Environment, ActorCritic

env = Environment.from_taillard(1)

# Actor-Critic solver
solver = ActorCritic(
    env,
    actor_lr=0.001,
    critic_lr=0.001,
    discount_factor=0.99
)

# Train with specific settings
solver.train(
    episodes=1000,
    max_steps=10000,
    verbose=True
)
```

## Performance Comparison

| Problem Size | Python-Only | With C++ | Speedup |
|-------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| 6x6         | 1.00x       | 8.45x    | 8.45x   |
| 10x10       | 1.00x       | 12.3x    | 12.3x   |
| 20x20       | 1.00x       | 15.7x    | 15.7x   |
